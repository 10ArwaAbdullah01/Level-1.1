## Setup and Tutorial

You will find the github part of this tutorial [here](https://github.com/Programming-Club-IAU/git-and-github)

### 1. Setup

#### 1.1: Install Python (not needed if you have a mac)

- Download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install Python
- Open a terminal and type `python --version` to check if Python is installed

#### 1.2: Install a Text Editor

- You can use any text editor you like, but I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download and install Visual Studio Code
- Open Visual Studio Code and install the Python extension

### 2. Tutorial

#### 2.1: Creating a new Python file

- Open Visual Studio Code
- Click on the "Explorer" icon on the left
- Click on the "New File" icon
- Save the file as `square.py`

#### 2.2: Basic Python

- Type the following code in `square.py`:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

- Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where `square.py` is located
- Type `python square.py` to run the program
- You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal

#### 2.3: Using Loops

- Type the following code in `square.py`:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")
```

- Run the program again
- You should see `Hello` printed 5 times in the terminal

#### 2.4: Using Functions

- Type the following code in `square.py`:

```python
def print_hello(size):
    for i in range(size):
        print("hello")

print_hello(5)
```

- Run the program again
- You should see `Hello` printed 5 times in the terminal

#### 2.5: Getting Input from the User

- Type the following code in `square.py`:

```python
def print_hello(size):
    for i in range(size):
        print("hello")

size = int(input("Enter the size of the square: "))
print_hello(size)
```

- Run the program again
- You should see `Hello` printed X times in the terminal
- Replace `X` with the number you entered
- If you entered `5`, you should see `Hello` printed 5 times in the terminal

## Project Overview

Your task is to write a program that prints a Staircase of a given size. The program should take the size of the Staircase as input from the user and print the Staircase accordingly.

### Requirements

- The program should take the size of the Staircase as input from the user
- The program should print a Staircase of the given size

Example:
```bash
*
**
***
****
*****
```

- The program should use a function to print the Staircase
- The program should use loops to print the Staircase
- The program should be written in Python

### Bonus

- The program should print both sides of the staircase.

Example:
```bash
    * *
   ** **
  *** ***
 **** ****
***** *****
```

## Submission Guidelines

- The app should be pushed to Github and a pull request should be created. You can check how to push your code to Github in section [2.1.2 Add Changes](https://github.com/Programming-Club-IAU/git-and-github#212-add-changes).
- The pull request title should be in the following format: `<your-name> - <project-name>`. You can check how to make a pull request in section [2.1.5. Create a pull request](ttps://github.com/Programming-Club-IAU/git-and-github#215-create-a-pull-request).
- The pull request description should contain the following:
  - A description of the changes made.
  - A screenshot of the app running in the terminal.
